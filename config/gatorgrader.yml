# Learn more about GatorGrader and its supported checks by visiting this web site:
# https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader

# Explanation:
# --> a check without an "--exact" runs a count for an entity as an "at least"
# --> checks below a file in a specified directory are for that specific file and directory
# --> checks that appear stand-alone are for an entire Git repository

# --> check the Python program
scheduler/scheduler/__main__.py:
    ConfirmFileExists
    MatchFileFragment --fragment "TODO" --count 0 --exact
    MatchFileFragment --fragment "from scheduler import schedule" --count 1 --exact
    CountMultipleLineComments --language Python --count 2
    CountSingleLineComments --language Python --count 4

# --> check the Python program
scheduler/scheduler/schedule.py:
    ConfirmFileExists
    MatchFileFragment --fragment "TODO" --count 0 --exact
    MatchFileFragment --fragment "from collections import OrderedDict" --count 1 --exact
    CountMultipleLineComments --language Python --count 2
    CountSingleLineComments --language Python --count 8

# --> confirm that the graphic exists
diagrams/memory-graph.png:
    ConfirmFileExists

# --> check the technical writing for various characteristics
writing/reflection.md:
    ConfirmFileExists
    CountFileWords --count 400
    CountMarkdownTags --tag "heading" --count 6 --exact
    CountMarkdownTags --tag "code" --count 1
    CountMarkdownTags --tag "code_block" --count 1
    MatchFileFragment --fragment "TODO" --count 0 --exact
    MatchFileFragment --fragment "Add Your Name Here" --count 0 --exact

# --> check that the number of commits in the Git repository is beyond a threshold
CountCommits --count 5

# --> check that the program executes correctly
ExecuteCommand --command "cd scheduler; poetry install; poetry run python scheduler --depth 3; cd .."
